    <!--I would like to acknowledge the assistance provided by ChatGPT which offered code suggestions for this project. Some examples of prompts I used include: 
How can I set it so that a different background image loads each time rather than a colour?
How do I make it so that the text links don't overlap each other?
Give me an intro to p5.sound.
The console is returning these errors: (list of errors provided).
Can you explain this code to me and what creates the position and amount of ellipses: (gradient code from https://p5js.org/examples/color-radial-gradient.html)?
How can I adapt the code so that there are more ellipses and they are sporadic on the page?
How can I through keyPressed() offer 5 different actions where one is randomly selected when the key is pressed each time?-->
